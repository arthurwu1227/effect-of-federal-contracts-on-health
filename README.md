# The Effect of Federal Health Contracts on Health Indicators
Code for a study regarding the effect of federal health contracts on health indicators in the United States. Was completed during the ASSIP summer program, a research experience for undergraduates and high school students at George Mason University.

This was one of my first significant projects, so there remain a lot of methodological weaknesses in my research paper and there are definitely areas of my code which could use refactoring and otherwise be improved.

The data for this project was obtained from usaspending.gov, which is a database of all contracts the federal government awarded to private contractors. We used data from the years 2016-2020 in our project. We used CDC data on causes of mortality for our dependent variable. For our covariates we used US Census data.

The final research paper has been published in the GMU Journal of Student-Scientists' Research, and can be accessed here: https://journals.gmu.edu/index.php/jssr/article/view/3399
