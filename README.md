# The Effect of Federal Contracts on Health
Research paper and code for a study regarding the effect of federal health contracts on health indicators in the United States. Was completed during the ASSIP summer program, a research experience for undergraduates and high school students at George Mason University.

This was one of my first significant projects, so there remain a lot of methodological weaknesses in my research paper and there are definitely areas of my code which could use refactoring.
